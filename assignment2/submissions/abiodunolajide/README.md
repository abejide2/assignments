## Kubernetes, Docker, Containerisation and Virtualisation

1. Portability: Containers are more portable than Virtual machines.
2. Resource usage: Containers have more effective resource usage than vms because containers have more dependencies, os, libraries and frameworks
3. Maintainability: Containers are eaier to maintain because codes can be broken down into manageable pieces
4. Containers are also highly scalable and better scalability than vms
5. Vms have better security boundary than containers because they can be isolated.
6. Vms can also run on more than one OS unlike conatiners which can run on only one OS
7. VMs also have more resources allocated than containers.
B. Docker Image is a template, a set of instructions in a code to create a Docker container.
To create a docker image, you need to write a Dockerfile that contains the instructions and commands to assemble the image. The Dockerfile should specify the base image, the maintainer, the run commands, and the exposed ports2. Then, you can use the docker build command to build the image from the Dockerfile. You can also tag the image with a name and a version, and specify the location of the Dockerfile.
Docker Container: A Docker container is a lightweight virtualized runtime environment for running applications. It contains code, system tools, runtime, libraries, dependencies, and configuration files required for running a specific application. Each container is independent and isolated from the host and other instances running on the host1. Docker containers are created from Docker images, which are lightweight, standalone, executable packages of software that include everything needed to run an application. Containers share the machine's OS system kernel and therefore do not require an OS per application, driving higher server efficiencies and reducing server and licensing costs.

## New commands logs - Enter up to ten new commands you have learnt this week

| Number      | Commands | What does it do and how might you check its effect     |
| :---        |    :----:   | :---  |
| 1  | pushd    |This command enables us to see the content of a folder without exit the preceeding folders    |
| 2  | popd      | This enables us to get back to the folders exit by command pushd without changing directories with cd   |
| 3  |mkdir       | make directory   |
| 4  |cat       |check the files in a directory   |
| 5  | rm -rf       | remove folder   |
| 6  | ls -la       |lists the content of a folder   |
| 7  | chown       |change ownership of a folder   |
| 8  | cd       |change directory   |
| 9  | cp        |copy file or directory   |
| 10 | mv      | move or rename file or directory   |
